# File Name         : UDP-Ping-Server.py
# Program Assignment: 2
# Author            : Kevin Rana
# Description       : Using UDP sockets, you will write a client and server program
# that enables the client to determine the one-way trip time (OTT) and round-trip time
# (RTT) to the server. To determine the delays, the client records the time when sending
# and receiving the packet to/from the server, and the server records the time when the
# packet is received. In the ping request the client sends to the server, it should
# include the (binary-encoded) 4-byte sequence number of the message sent. In the ping
# response, the server should echo back the clientâ€™s sequence number, and also include
# the 8-byte serverâ€™s reception time . On receiving the ping response,
# the client has all the information it needs to determine the OTT and RTT for that packet.
